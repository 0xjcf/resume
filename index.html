            <li>
              I led the development of frontend enterprise components utilized
              by multiple teams, which significantly improved the application's
              user interface and interactivity. I was responsible for leading
              the modernization effort of legacy MobX and React code to the
              latest version of React. This involved utilizing hooks and
              integrating XState and the Context API for state management and
              business logic optimization. This initiative streamlined
              development processes, improved component reusability, and
              facilitated state management, contributing to a more maintainable
              and scalable codebase.
            </li>
            <li>
              In addition, I oversaw a significant refactoring project to
              introduce a configuration-based approach for constructing and
              displaying UI components dynamically based on backend responses.
              This innovative approach greatly enhanced UI flexibility and user
              experience. It also allowed for swift adjustments to the
              application interface without requiring any additional coding,
              which reduced development time and improved the application's
              ability to adapt to evolving business needs.

              infrastructure migration from Ruby on Rails to Quarkus. This

              interactivity. Finally, I ensured that all features, both old and
              new, were reliable and functional by thoroughly implementing unit
